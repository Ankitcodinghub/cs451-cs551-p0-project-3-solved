1 Introduction

For our final project, you will be implementing a peer-to-peer chat program. This is a non-trivial program; our base repository for the project is of meaningful size:

You can accept the GitHub classroom assignment (which is forked from the template repository) at https://classroom.github.com/a/tB4hTcTC.

It will be iterated on again for future classes. With this in mind, there are definitely rough edges, places where the code is confusing or verbose, and many places where the code can be improved in terms of both ergonomics (e.g., the API) as well as refactoring (making more structs, renaming things, etc.).

ASK QUESTIONS IF YOU DON‚ÄôT UNDERSTAND SOMETHING IN THE CODE! It might be that it‚Äôs something that I can easily explain, something that I‚Äôm aware of but just didn‚Äôt have time to refactor/fix, or it might be a real problem/bug in the code. I wrote all of this, so I should be able to help you figure out what is going on.

2 Project Description

This project is about building a peer-to-peer chat client. We have seen what a very basic chat server looks like. While our chat server had tons of limitations, it also ran just fine on a single thread using async programming. For each client that connected, we started two tasks: one that received data from the network (i.e., data from whatever client was sending us) and a second that received data from the server (in our case, a broadcast channel that the server set up when a client connected). Note that while both of these tasks ended up interacting with the network, they didn‚Äôt have to. This is an important observation because it means we can launch tasks for a bunch of different purposes, and as long as we can reduce the amount of blocking code in those tasks, we can very efficiently scale.

2.1 Scaling with asyncAssignment Project Exam Help

I use an open source server that scheduling of jobs. I.e., handing out jobs to a set of waiting ‚Äúworkers‚Äù that process those jobs. The server has a protocol to communicate with clients, but it is agnostic about how that client works and how jobs are actually executed by workers.

I have my own client, written in Rust. It is relatively simple, and handles a lot of things that are relevant specifically to crawling social media data, e.g., rate limiting. At its core, it manages a collection of long lived workers, where each worker runs in its own task. My library can scale to tens of thousands of concurrently executing workers, on a single thread.

However, there is relatively little computationally expensive code involved (and when there is, that is farmed out to a secondary service). It takes microseconds (less?) to do whatever data manipulation and logic it takes to control the crawling process; it takes milliseconds to make a request to a web site. Thus, the overwhelming majority time a worker is executing a job it is waiting for some I/O request to get data. While any particular job might be ‚Äúslow‚Äù to execute, we can run so many of them concurrently that our throughput scales way higher.

3 bing2bing

bing2bing is the name of our peer-to-peer chat system. Our protocol is going to be more complicated than the simple chat server we made in class. It will support several commands, and instead of being simply line oriented, we will use a higher level abstraction for our wire protocol: JSON.

3.1 Frames

A valid frame in bing2bing can be composed of the following types:

‚Ä¢ Text ‚Äì a string.

‚Ä¢ Error ‚Äì an error.

‚Ä¢ Number ‚Äì an unsigned 64 bit number.

‚Ä¢ Bulk ‚Äì raw bytes. ‚Ä¢ Bool ‚Äì true/false.

Assignment Project Exam Help

A command is a logical abstraction. they get encoded/decoded into frames and sent/received over the wire.

We will support the following commands:

‚Ä¢ Broadcast ‚Äì deliver data (i.e., arbitrary bytes) to all peers in the network.

‚Ä¢ Ping ‚Äì allows peers to measure latency between them.

‚Ä¢ Pong ‚Äì a response to a Ping command.

‚Ä¢ Register ‚Äì register with a tracking server.

‚Ä¢ Say ‚Äì send a chat message to all peers in the network.

‚Ä¢ Deliver ‚Äì deliver data (i.e., arbitrary bytes) to a specific peer.

‚Ä¢ Announce ‚Äì a command that is propagated through the network to provide peers knowledge about the network topography. I.e., this is how peers let each other know who they are connected to.

‚Ä¢ Whisper ‚Äì send a chat message to a specific peer in the network.

‚Ä¢ Extension ‚Äì an arbitrary protocol extension. Peers that know how to handle a specific extension will handle them, peers that don‚Äôt know how to handle them will forward/broadcast on to the rest of the network.

4 Grading

Grading will be similar to the style of Projects 1 and 2.

‚Ä¢ -1,000 points: If you do not update CREDITS.md with the names of your group members, as well as an honest break down of the work each group member did, you will receive NEGATIVE ONE THOUSAND points. I.e., it would be next to impossible to get anything higher than a zero on this project.

‚Ä¢ -1,000 points: If running cargo fmt results in any change to your repository, you will get NEGATIVE ONE THOUSAND points. Be sure to run cargo fmt!!!!!!!!!

‚Ä¢ -1,000 points: No warnings should be produced when running ‚Äòcargo check‚Äò or ‚Äòcargo clippy‚Äô.Assignment Project Exam Help

‚Ä¢ -1,000 points: If you do not do a demo (only one group member needs to be present for a demo), you will receive -1,000 points.

‚Ä¢ 50 points: Program compiles, as well as the items noted below as required for graduate groups.

‚Ä¢ 10 points: Implement at least one extension.

‚Ä¢ 20 points: REQUIRED FOR GRADUATE GROUPS. Implement routing of messages. Instead of just broadcasting commands that have an expected destination (e.g., Ping, Deliver, Whisper), use a peer‚Äôs knowledge of the network topology to route a message via shortest path.

‚Ä¢ 5 points: Make things fully decentralized. Our base project will make use of a distinct tracker to let peers boostrap their first connection. It is not necessary for this to be a separate program. Implement handling of the Register command in your peer, thus allowing any other client to bootstrap off your peer instead of having a stand alone tracker.

‚Ä¢ 5 points: Comprehensive documentation. Points will be determined by looking at the documentation built when running cargo doc ‚Äìdocument-private-items ‚Äìno-deps.

‚Ä¢ 10 points: Performance analysis. E.g., how many connections can your peer handle? Are there any overlay network topologies that could cause performance/robustness issues? How well can the network handle churn (i.e., peers joining/leaving a lot)?

‚Ä¢ 5 points: Proper error handling. There will be at least some unwraps()s in the base project. Also, right now, most of the error handling is via very weakly developed custom error types that could be made much better. Fix this by adding proper error handling (e.g., with the thiserror crate) and nice error messaging. Points will be determined by how comprehensive error handling is.

‚Ä¢ 10 points: Fancy UI. There are a lot of opportunities here!

‚Ä¢ 10 points: Refactoring, code clean up, and ergonomics. Clean up the code and make it easier to use! Be sure to summarize what you have done here in a CHANGELOG.md file in your repository.

‚Ä¢ 5 points: Add meaningful logging. Using the tracing crate to generate logs. Points will be determined on comprehensiveness of logs, as well as the usage of different log levels.

‚Ä¢ Unlimited points: Cool factor. Points are determined subjectively by me, but if I find anything about your project to be particularly unique, difficult, clever, etc., you can get some extra points. Note that this applies to other items above. E.g., if you do something cool with an ExtensionAssignment Project Exam Help, you will get cool points in addition to the 10 points for implementing an

EXTENSION.

in the README.md to grade, so make sure you test all the instructions, etc.

4.1 Allowed Crates

Generally speaking, you are free to use any crates listed on https://blessed.rs, except networking crates. I want networking to be handled online with things from the Rust standard library and tokio.

Any crates not on Blessed.rs need to be approved by Jeremy.

Be sure to note what crates you use in your README.md!

REMEMBER THAT IF YOU USE A MACHINE LEARNING TOOL THAT IS CHEATING AND YOU WILL FAIL THE CLASS!
